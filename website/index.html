		<a href="http://www.generation-msx.nl/msxdb/softwareinfo/916">The Maze of Galious</a> (MoG in short) was originally a Konami game for the MSX computer system. Its real name is <em>Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious</em> and is the sequel of another Konami game called <a href="http://www.generation-msx.nl/msxdb/softwareinfo/855">Knightmare</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		MoG is a very addictive game where you have to kill thousands of enemies, collect items in order to obtain new powers and defeat some really great demons at the end of each level. The gameplay of MoG is not the boring linear one. In MoG you are free to go everywhere you want from the beginning of the game. You have to be very careful of the order in which you visit all the rooms in the HUGE map if you want to keep your character alive. The map is structured in a main map (called the <em>castle</em>) and 10 submaps (called the <em>worlds</em>). Initially you are in the castle and you have to find the keys that open the doors to go to each of the worlds. To complete the game you have to defeat the boss at the end of each one of the 10 worlds. You are free to revisit each world as often as you want in order to see if you have missed something. To defeat all 10 demons you control two characters: <em>Popolon</em> and <em>Aphrodite</em>. Each one has special abilities, i.e. Popolon has a greater ability to jump and Aphrodite is able to dive.

	<h1>Story</h1>
	<p>
		This is a legend that has been told since long, long ago...
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to save Aphrodite, the princess of Greek, who was kidnapped by the dark overlord Hudnos, the good knight Popolon set out for the dark castle located in the depths of Mount Atlas. However, it actually was a trap set by the evil high priest Galious. He used evil spirits to do his bidding and was well versed in black arts. He sold his own soul to the devil and was the very incarnation of evil. In Popolon's absence, Galious invaded the kingdom of Greek along with his demons and made the kingdom his base for his plans to turn the world into a realm of darkness. The true dark castle was Castle Greek itself! Galious then went to heaven and kidnapped the yet unborn Pampas, who was to be born to Popolon and Aphrodite and shut the baby away in the castle.
	</p>
	<p>
		After rescuing Aphrodite, Popolon returned to Castle Greek. He sensed a strange presence about the castle and soon derived what had happened. In order to take back Castle Greek and rescue their future child from the hands of the dark powers, the two entered the gates of the castle knowing that this could cost them their lives.
	</p>
	<p>
		The stage is now set for the true climax to <em>'The Demon Legend'</em>...

	<h2>Characters and components</h2>
	
	<h3>Popolon</h3>
	<div class="img"><img src="pics/popolon.gif" alt="popolon" /></div>
	<p>
		Popolon is a true warrior. He saved Aphrodite in the previous game, Knightmare.
	</p>
	<p>
		Popolon can destroy rocks a lot faster than Aphrodite can, but he'll rapidly lose power in water. Popolon can pass through revolving doors, while Aphrodite can't. And his jumping height depends on how long the UP key is pressed.
	</p>
	<h3>Aphrodite</h3>
	<div class="img"><img src="pics/aphrodite.gif" alt="aphrodite" /></div>
	<p>
		Aphrodite is the Greek Goddess of love.
	</p>
	<p>
		Aphrodite can swim, while Popolon can't. She can make three shots at a time, while Popolon can only shoot two. The same is true for mines; she can put three down. Also, the jumping height is constant with Aphrodite.
	</p>


	<h3>Enemies</h3>

	<h3>But there's more!</h3>
	<p>		
		Of course this is only a brief glimpse of everything the game has to offer. There's lots of other items, enemies, demons and worlds for you to conquer!

<div id="passwords">
	<h1>Password decoding</h1>
	<p>
		Maze of Galious contains a password system that's used to restore your games. Because this is an integral part of the game this also should be present in the remake. Therefore Santi decided to decode the password system and write down his findings. You can read all about this on the special <a href="passwords.html">password decoding</a> page.
